Welcome to my blog! 👋

I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and I'm finally making it happen. Here, I'll be sharing my thoughts on:

- **Engineering practices** — What I'm learning, building, and experimenting with
- **Mentorship** — Lessons from both sides of the mentoring relationship
- **Inclusive tech** — Building products and teams that work for everyone
- **Career growth** — Navigating the tech industry, especially for folks from non-traditional backgrounds

## Why Start a Blog?

After years of having conversations at conferences, in mentorship sessions, and in one-on-ones, I realized a lot of what I share could help more people if I wrote it down.

> "For folks coming from non-business backgrounds, you're not only learning the language of tech, but the language of business. And that can be very intimidating — but like anything else, it's learnable."

That's something I said in an interview once, and it's stuck with me. If you have the drive for this industry, there's a place for you here.

## What to Expect

I'll try to post regularly, but quality over quantity. Each post will aim to be:

1. **Practical** — Something you can apply
2. **Honest** — Real experiences, not just success stories
3. **Accessible** — Written for humans, not algorithms

Thanks for being here. Let's build something better together.
